Markers
===========

Adding marker files to this directory will have the following effects:

enable_jpda - Will enable the JPDA socket based transport on the java virtual
              machine running the JBoss AS 7 application server. This enables
              you to remotely debug code running inside the JBoss AS 7
              application server.

skip_maven_build - Maven build step will be skipped

force_clean_build - Will start the build process by removing all non 
essential Maven dependencies.  Any current dependencies specified in 
your pom.xml file will then be re-downloaded.

hot_deploy - Will prevent a JBoss container restart during build/deployment.
             Newly build archives will be re-deployed automatically by the
             JBoss HDScanner component.
             
java7 - Will run JBoss AS7 with Java7 if present. If no marker is present then the 
			baseline Java version will be used (currently Java6)
