Warning - updating from version 1.0.0
-------------------------------------
If you're updating from version 1.0.0, feed history will be deleted. See why [here](https://www.commafeed.com/announcement/20130725.html).

The last commit with no data loss has been [tagged](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/1.0.0). 

Deployment on OpenShift
-----------------------

Hosting an application on OpenShift is free. 
At the moment those instructions are not working because the application takes too long to build on OpenShift and causes a timeout. 
See [here](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2013/05/25/greader/) for an alternative method.

* Create an account on [OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com/).
* Add an application, select `JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0`.
* For the `Public URL` set the name you want (e.g. `commafeed`).
* For the `Source Code` option, click `Change` and set this repository (`https://github.com/Athou/commafeed.git`).
* Click `Create Application`.
* Click `Add cartridge` and select `MySQL`.
* Wait a couple of minutes and access your application.
* The default user is `admin` and the password is `admin`.

Deployment on your own server
-----------------------------

For storage, you can either use an embedded HSQLDB database or an external MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLServer database.
You also need Maven 3.x (and a Java 1.7+ JDK) installed in order to build the application.

To install maven and openjdk on Ubuntu, issue the following commands

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:natecarlson/maven3
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk maven3
    
    Not required but if you don't, use 'mvn3' instead of 'mvn' for the rest of the instructions.
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/mvn3 /usr/bin/mvn
    
On Windows and other operating systems, just download maven 3.x from the [official site](http://maven.apache.org/), extract it somewhere and add the `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
    
Download the sources (it doesn't matter where, you can delete the directory when you're done).
If you don't have git you can download the sources as a zip file from [here](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/archive/master.zip)

    git clone https://github.com/Athou/commafeed.git
    cd commafeed
    
Now build the application

	Embedded HSQL database:
    mvn clean package tomee:build -Pprod
    
	External MySQL database:
    mvn clean package tomee:build -Pprod -Pmysql
    
    External PostgreSQL database:
    mvn clean package tomee:build -Pprod -Ppgsql
    
    External Microsoft SQL Server database:
    mvn clean package tomee:build -Pprod -Pmssql
    
It will generate a zip file at `target/commafeed.zip` with everything you need to run the application.

* Create a directory somewhere (e.g. `/opt/commafeed/`) and extract the generated zip inside this directory.
* Create a directory called `logs` (e.g. `/opt/commafeed/logs`)
* Copy the file `conf/setenv.sh` (Linux) or `conf/setenv.bat` (Windows) to `bin/`
* If you don't use the embedded database, create a database in your external database instance, then uncomment the `Resource` element corresponding to the database engine you use from `conf/tomee.xml` and edit the default credentials.
* If you'd like to change the default port (8082), edit `conf/server.xml` and look for `<Connector port="8082" protocol="HTTP/1.1"`. Change the port to the value you'd like to use.
* CommaFeed will run on the `/commafeed` context. If you'd like to change the context, go to `webapps` and rename `commafeed.war`. Use the special name `ROOT.war` to deploy to the root context.
* To start and stop the application, use `bin/startup.sh` and `bin/shutdown.sh` on Linux (you need to `chmod +x bin/*.sh`) or `bin\startup.bat` and `bin\shutdown.bat` on Windows.
* To update the application with a newer version, pull the latest changes and use the same command you used to build the complete TomEE package, but without the `tomee:build` part (keep `-Pprod -P<database>`). 
This will generate the file `target/commafeed.war`. Copy this file to your tomee `webapps/` directory.
* The application is online at [http://localhost:8082/commafeed](http://localhost:8082/commafeed). Don't forget to set the public URL in the admin settings.
* The default user is `admin` and the password is `admin`.

Local development
-----------------

Checkout the code and use maven to build and start a local TomEE instance.

 `mvn clean package tomee:run`

The application is online at [http://localhost:8082/commafeed](http://localhost:8082/commafeed). Any change to the source code will be applied immediatly.
The default user is `admin` and the password is `admin`.

Translate CommaFeed into your language
--------------------------------------

Files for internationalization are located [here](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/master/src/main/resources/i18n).

To add a new language, create a new file in that directory.
The name of the file should be the two-letters [ISO-639-1 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
The language has to be referenced in the `languages.properties` file to be picked up.

When adding new translations, add them in en.properties then run `mvn -e groovy:execute -Pi18n`. It will parse the english file and add placeholders in the other translation files. 

Themes
---------------------

To create a theme, create a new file  `src/main/webapp/sass/themes/_<theme>.scss`. Your styles should be wrapped in a `#theme-<theme>` element and use the [SCSS format](http://sass-lang.com/) which is a superset of CSS.

Don't forget to reference your theme in `src/main/webapp/sass/app.scss` and in `src/main/webapp/js/controllers.js` (look for `$scope.themes`).

See [_test.scss](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/blob/master/src/main/webapp/sass/themes/_test.scss) for an example.
