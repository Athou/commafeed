Deploy on any JavaEE6 container or better yet on OpenShift.

Deployment on OpenShift
-----------------------

Hosting an application on OpenShift is free.

* Create an account on [OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com/).
* Add an application, select `JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0`.
* For the `Public URL` set the name you want (e.g. `commafeed`).
* For the `Source Code` option, click `Change` and set this repository (`https://github.com/Athou/commafeed.git`).
* Click `Create Application`.
* Click `Add cartridge` and select `MySQL`.
* Wait a couple of minutes and access your application.
* The default user is `admin` and the password is `admin`.

Deployment on your own server
-----------------------------

For storage, you can either use an embedded HSQLDB database or an external MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
You also need maven (and a Java JDK) installed in order to build the application.

To install maven and openjdk on Ubuntu, issue the following commands

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:natecarlson/maven3
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk maven3
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/mvn3 /usr/bin/mvn
    
Now build the application

	Embedded HSQL database (not recommended, ok for quick tests but automatic schema updates are not working):
    mvn clean package tomee:build -Pprod
    
	External MySQL database:
    mvn clean package tomee:build -Pprod -Pmysql
    
    External PostgreSQL database:
    mvn clean package tomee:build -Pprod -Ppgsql
    
It will generate a zip file at `target/commafeed.zip` with everything you need to run the application.

* Create a directory somewhere (e.g. `/opt/commafeed/`) and extract the generated zip inside this directory.
* Create a directory called `logs` (e.g. `/opt/commafeed/logs`)
* On Linux, create the file `bin/setenv.sh` and put the following in it : `export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"`
* On Windows, create the file `bin/setenv.bat` and put the following in it : `set JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"`
* If you don't use the embedded database, create a database in your external database instance, then uncomment the `Resource` element corresponding to the database engine you use from `conf/tomee.xml` and edit the default credentials.
* If you'd like to change the default port (8082), edit `conf/server.xml` and look for `<Connector port="8082" protocol="HTTP/1.1"`. Change the port to the value you'd like to use.
* CommaFeed will run on the `/commafeed` context. If you'd like to change the context, go to `webapps` and rename `commafeed.war`. Use the special name `ROOT.war` to deploy to the root context.
* To start and stop the application, use `bin/startup.sh` and `bin/shutdown.sh` on Linux (you may need to `chmod +x bin/*.sh`) or `bin\startup.bat` and `bin\shutdown.bat` on Windows.
* To update the application with a newer version, pull the latest changes and use the same command you used to build the complete TomEE package, but without the `tomee:build` part. 
This will generate the file `target/commafeed.war`. Copy this file to your tomee `webapps/` directory.

Local development
-----------------

Checkout the code and use maven to build and start a local TomEE instance.

 `mvn clean package tomee:run`

The application is online at [http://localhost:8082/commafeed](http://localhost:8082/commafeed). Any change to the source code will be applied immediatly.

Translate CommaFeed into your language
--------------------------------------

Files for internationalization are located [here](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/master/src/main/resources/i18n).

To add a new language, create a new file in that directory.
The name of the file should be the two-letters [ISO-639-1 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
The language has to be referenced in the `languages.properties` file to be picked up.
