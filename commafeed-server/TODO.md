TODO
----

MVP:

- update github actions
    - release after tag
        - new job that downloads all artifacts because we need them all to create the release
- update readme
- update docker readme
- update release notes (+ mention h2 migration has been removed, upgrade to last 4.x is required)

Nice to have:

- find a better way to scan rome classes
- remove suppresswarnings "deprecation"
- remove rest assured or use only rest assured
- rename "servlets" since they are now rest endpoints
- warnings hibernate on startup
- OPML encoding is not handled correctly
- remove Timers metrics page
