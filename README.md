## Translation

Files for internationalization are
located [here](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/master/commafeed-client/src/locales).

To add a new language:

- add the new locale to the `locales` array in:
    - `commafeed-client/.linguirc`
    - `commafeed-client/src/i18n.ts`
- run `npm run i18n:extract`
- add translations to the newly created `commafeed-client/src/locales/[locale]/messages.po` file

The name of the locale should be the
two-letters [ISO-639-1 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

## Local development

### Backend

- Open `commafeed-server` in your preferred Java IDE.
    - CommaFeed uses Lombok, you need the Lombok plugin for your IDE.
- Start `CommaFeedApplication.java` in debug mode with `server config.dev.yml` as arguments

### Frontend

- Open `commafeed-client` in your preferred JavaScript IDE.
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`

The frontend server is now running at http://localhost:8082 and is proxying REST requests to the backend running on
port 8083
